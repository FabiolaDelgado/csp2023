    <p>My name is Fabiola Delgado I am in 9th grade in my freshmen year at Santa Ana High School. I took a PLTW class in middle school in my 6th and 8th year. I earned one award for my PLTW class in 8th grade. The reason I am taking this course is because I wanted to learn more about technology and what I can do with it. Some personal interests are cooking and drawing. Some hobbies I have are walking my dogs and learning to cook from my mom.</p>
